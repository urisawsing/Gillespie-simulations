# Gillespie-simulations

An example of the Gillespie algorithm implementation and a Quasi Steady State approximation
for a self-gene regulating system

The algorithm starts with concentrations $X_1=X_2=0$ and exit when the iterations or the time go over a threshold

The program is executed by running the gill_alg.py, the functions.py is a auxiliar code with all the functions used by the algorithm

Requirements:
              Python 3 or higher
              numpy
              scipy
              matplotlib
              time
              random
